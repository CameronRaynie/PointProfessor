<h1 class="Chalky">About the Point Professor App</h1>
<p id="paraBox" class="Chalky">This app was created to help students determine just how much an assignment will affect their grade.
  Many schools and universities use a weighted point system, this tool allows the user to determine how much those points are worth when converted to an overall percent grade.
